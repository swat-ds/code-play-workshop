#   :shipit: Code/Play: Creative Programming for Non-Programmers :shipit:

Nabil Kashyap (@bulbil)

Learn to play with code using p5.js (https://p5js.org/). Think of it as an intervention into the relationship we might be cultivating with our computers right now. Rather than awkward virtual sociality and media-induced stress, consider instead the simple delight of creating interactive "sketches". Plus plug into an awesome organization upending programming stereotypes. We will learn the basics of shapes, animation, interaction, and data
incorporating data -- all in the browser. Geared towards beginners but experienced coders are welcome, too.

## What are we doing?

### Let’s see how far we get (overview)

- basics of p5.js
- computer graphics concepts
- animation & interaction
- data

#### basics

- `setup() {}`
- `createCanvas(width, height)`
- `draw() {}`
- comment/uncomment (⌘ + `/`)

#### computer graphics

- coordinate plane
- color
- fill
- stroke
- shapes (*2D primitives, excuse me ...*)

#### animation & interaction

- the `draw()` loop
- increment/decrement
- random
- events
- `for` loops

#### data ( :information_desk_person: maybe?)

- loading URLs
- accessing data values
